# BLDC Motor Testing Unit
BLDC Motor Testing Unit is driven by Arduino Uno and uses SimonK ESC. It uses a potentiometer to vary the speed of a Brush-Less DC (BLDC) Motor and tests its performance.

Hardware connctions are as follows:

POT right    - Arduino +5V
POT middle   - Arduino A2
POT left     - Arduino GND

ESC data wire (white/yellow) - Arduino pin 3 (PWM)
ESC GND wire (black)         - Arduino GND
ESC power wire (red)         - DO NOT CONNECT
